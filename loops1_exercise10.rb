# Your friends just showed up! Given the following array of names, use a for loop to greet each friend individually.

friends = ['Sarah', 'John', 'Hannah', 'Dave']

for friend in friends
 puts "Hello #{friend}!"
end

# refactored down from my solution, which worked but used needless counter and 'i' named variable instead of 'friend'... learned something! :)
